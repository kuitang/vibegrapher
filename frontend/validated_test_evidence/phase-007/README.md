# Phase 007: Diff Handling - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully implemented Monaco diff editor with Accept/Reject controls and AlertDialog confirmation.

## Components Created

### 1. DiffViewer Component (`src/components/DiffViewer.tsx`)
- Monaco DiffEditor integration with unified/split view modes
- Tab switching between views
- Accept (green) and Reject (red) buttons with proper styling
- AlertDialog for confirmation before accepting changes
- Session ID tooltip on info icon
- Diff statistics display (+additions/-deletions)

### 2. CodePanel Component (`src/components/CodePanel.tsx`)
- Container that switches between CodeViewer and DiffViewer
- WebSocket integration for diff_created events
- Diff parsing logic for unified diff format
- API calls for accepting/rejecting diffs
- Test function (window.testDiff()) for demonstration

## Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ Diff viewer appears when patch received
✅ Tabs switch between unified/split view
✅ Accept Button (green) applies changes
✅ Reject Button (red) dismisses diff
✅ AlertDialog confirms before accepting
✅ Tooltip shows session_id on hover
✅ Code view updates after accept (ready for integration)

## Evidence
1. `diff-viewer.png` - Shows working diff viewer with:
   - Unified view with syntax highlighting

   - Accept/Reject buttons
   - Diff statistics (+6/-0)

2. `alert-dialog.png` - Shows confirmation dialog with:
   - "Accept Changes?" title

- Alert confirmation flow
- Dark theme support

## Integration Points
- Ready to receive `diff_created` WebSocket events from backend
- API endpoints prepared for `/api/diffs/{id}/accept` and `/api/diffs/{id}/reject`
- Automatic code viewer update after accepting changes

## Next Steps
- Phase 008: Human Review UI (final phase)
