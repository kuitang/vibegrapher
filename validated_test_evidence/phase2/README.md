# Phase 2: Real-time Socket.io Streaming Test Evidence

This directory contains evidence from Phase 2 testing, which verifies that OpenAI RunItemStreamEvents are delivered via Socket.io in real-time without requiring page refresh.

## Test Objectives

1. **Real-time Delivery**: Verify that stream events appear immediately via Socket.io
2. **No Page Refresh**: Confirm messages appear without any page reload
3. **Comprehensive Fields**: Ensure all new ConversationMessage fields are transmitted
4. **Socket Connection**: Verify stable Socket.io connection during streaming
5. **Message Ordering**: Confirm stream sequences arrive in correct order

## Evidence Files

- `phase2-results.json`: Main test results with real-time message counts
- `streaming-analysis.json`: Analysis of different message types received
- `connection-test.json`: Socket connection stability during streaming
- `*.png`: Screenshots showing real-time message arrival

## Key Validations

✅ Messages arrive via Socket.io without page refresh  
✅ All ConversationMessage fields are transmitted in real-time  
✅ Socket connection remains stable during streaming  
✅ Stream events appear immediately as they're generated  
✅ User and assistant messages properly differentiated  
✅ Tool calls and token usage visible in real-time  

## Phase 2 Implementation Changes

1. **Socket.io Service**: Updated emit_conversation_message with all ConversationMessage fields
2. **Frontend Types**: Extended ConversationMessageEvent with streaming fields
3. **Message Store**: Updated Message interface for comprehensive field support
4. **VibecodePanel**: Modified to handle real-time streaming message structure
5. **Socket Events**: Changed from 'join_project' to 'subscribe' to match backend

## Comparison: Phase 1 vs Phase 2

**Phase 1**: Messages persist to database, visible after page refresh  
**Phase 2**: Messages stream in real-time via Socket.io, no refresh needed

## Next Steps

Phase 2 completes real-time streaming implementation. Future phases could add:
- Message editing/retrying
- Stream event filtering
- Token usage visualization
- Real-time typing indicators
