# Phase 1: Database Persistence Test Evidence

This directory contains evidence from Phase 1 testing, which verifies that OpenAI RunItemStreamEvents are properly persisted to the database and can be fetched via API.

## Test Objectives

1. **Stream Event Capture**: Verify that each RunItemStreamEvent creates a ConversationMessage record
2. **Field Extraction**: Ensure all important fields are extracted:
   - Tool calls and outputs
   - Token usage (input, output, total, cached, reasoning)
   - Stream sequence numbers
   - Event metadata
3. **API Retrieval**: Confirm messages can be fetched via GET /sessions/{id}/messages
4. **Page Refresh**: Messages appear after page refresh (no real-time updates yet)

## Evidence Files

- `phase1-results.json`: Main test results with message counts
- `stream-events-details.json`: Detailed breakdown of persisted stream events  
- `token-usage.json`: Evidence of token usage extraction
- `api-messages.json`: Sample API responses showing new fields
- `*.png`: Screenshots showing messages before and after refresh

## Key Validations

✅ Messages persist to database during streaming
✅ All RunItemStreamEvent types are captured
✅ Token usage is properly extracted
✅ Tool calls and outputs are stored in typed fields
✅ Stream sequences are consecutive with no gaps
✅ Messages are fetchable via API after streaming completes

## Phase 1 Implementation Changes

1. **ConversationMessage Model**: Expanded with comprehensive fields for RunResult types
2. **VibecodeService**: Uses `Runner.run_streamed()` with `stream_events()` iteration
3. **Message Creation**: Each stream event creates a database record immediately
4. **API Schema**: MessageResponse includes all new fields

## Next: Phase 2

Phase 2 will add real-time Socket.io updates so messages appear without page refresh.
