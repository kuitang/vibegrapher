# Vibegrapher Pre-Flight Check Report v2

## Executive Summary
All critical issues have been resolved. The documents are now consistent, properly numbered, and ready for implementation. Key improvements include fixed phase numbering, clarified dependencies, consistent path conventions, and clear instructions about model definitions.

## RESOLVED ISSUES ✅

### 1. ✅ GPT-5 Model References
**CONFIRMED**: All gpt-5 mentions properly documented with IMPORTANT NOTE texts in:
- spec_backend_v0.md
- prompt_backend_v0.md

### 2. ✅ Phase Numbering Fixed
- Backend phases 001-005 now correctly numbered in file content
- Frontend phases 001-008 properly sequenced
- No duplicate phase numbers
- File names match internal phase numbers

### 3. ✅ Diff Model Creation Clarified
- backend-phase-003-agents.md now explicitly states it creates the Diff model
- References spec_datamodel_v0.md lines 229-258 for schema
- Includes validation requirements for testing diff creation flow
- Clear deliverables including Diff model in app/models/diff.py

### 4. ✅ Path Conventions Standardized
**Decision**: Work from project root, use explicit paths
- Backend: `backend/app/...`, `backend/tests/...`, `backend/validated_test_evidence/...`
- Frontend: `frontend/src/...`, `frontend/tests/...`, `frontend/validated_test_evidence/...`
- Clear instructions in prompts to stay in project root
- Commands use `--prefix` or explicit paths

### 5. ✅ SQLiteSession Consistency
- Updated to include db_path parameter: `SQLiteSession(session_key, db_path)`
- spec_backend_v0.md:74-75 and prompt_backend_v0.md:118-119 now consistent
- File persistence requirement clearly stated

### 6. ✅ Test Evidence Directories
- Clearly specified: `backend/validated_test_evidence/phase-XXX/`
- Clearly specified: `frontend/validated_test_evidence/phase-XXX/`
- All phase documents updated with correct paths

### 7. ✅ Frontend Dependencies Updated
- All backend dependency references use correct file names
- Dependencies properly ordered (backend-phase-003 creates Diff model)
- Clear verification instructions in each phase

### 8. ✅ Added Model Reference Instructions
- Both prompts now include: "If you are unsure about a model or API definition, read spec_datamodel_v0.md"
- Diff model location clearly referenced in backend-phase-003

## NEW IMPROVEMENTS

### Working Directory Convention
**Critical Addition**: Both prompts now emphasize:
- ALWAYS work from project root directory
- NEVER cd into backend/ or frontend/
- Check `pwd` if commands fail
- Use explicit paths from root

### Command Examples Updated
- Backend: `pytest backend/tests`, `mypy backend/app/`
- Frontend: `npm --prefix frontend install`, `npm --prefix frontend test`
- Clear examples for all common operations

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST ✅

All items verified:
- ✅ All phase numbers match file names
- ✅ No duplicate phase numbers
- ✅ All dependency references use correct file names
- ✅ SQLiteSession usage is consistent
- ✅ Test evidence directories are consistent
- ✅ Diff model creation explicitly stated in phase 003
- ✅ No forward references to undefined components
- ✅ gpt-5 references maintain IMPORTANT NOTE texts
- ✅ Working directory conventions clearly stated
- ✅ Path conventions standardized

## PHASE EXECUTION ORDER (VERIFIED)

### Backend (Must Complete First)
1. ✅ backend-phase-001-infrastructure.md
2. backend-phase-002-socketio.md 
3. backend-phase-003-agents.md (creates Diff model)
4. backend-phase-004-sessions.md
5. backend-phase-005-human-review.md

### Frontend (After Backend Dependencies)
1. ✅ frontend-phase-001-layout.md (no backend deps)
2. frontend-phase-002-socketio.md (needs backend-002)
3. frontend-phase-003-session.md (needs backend 001, 003, 004)
4. frontend-phase-004-code-viewer.md (needs backend 001, 002)
5. frontend-phase-005-diff.md (needs backend 003, 005)
6. frontend-phase-006-mobile.md (no backend deps)
7. frontend-phase-007-human-review.md (needs backend 003, 004, 005)
8. frontend-phase-008-local-persistence.md (no backend deps)

## KEY REMINDERS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

1. **Stay in Project Root**: Never cd into subdirectories
2. **Use Explicit Paths**: Always prefix with backend/ or frontend/
3. **Check spec_datamodel_v0.md**: For all model definitions
4. **Test Diff Creation**: Phase 003 must verify diff endpoints work
5. **Real OpenAI API**: Never mock OpenAI calls
6. **gpt-5 Models Are Real**: Use gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-mini

## CONCLUSION

The specification documents are now consistent, properly structured, and ready for LLM implementation. All critical issues have been resolved, dependencies are clear, and the implementation path is well-defined.

**Status: ✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
