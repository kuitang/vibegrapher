# Backend Implementation Status

## Completed Phases

### Phase 001: Core Infrastructure ✅
- SQLAlchemy models with TimestampMixin
- Basic CRUD endpoints for projects
- Type safety with mypy
- Pydantic schemas for validation

### Phase 002: Socket.io & Real-time ✅
- Socket.io server with python-socketio
- Real-time event broadcasting
- Project room subscriptions
- Heartbeat mechanism

### Phase 003: Git Service & Database Seeding ✅
- GitService for repository management
- pygit2 integration for git operations
- Database seeding with sample agent code
- Test cases management

### Phase 004: OpenAI Agents ✅
- VibeCoder and Evaluator agents using gpt-5
- submit_patch tool with validation
- Tenacity for exponential backoff
- Real OpenAI API integration (no mocks)
- Token usage tracking

### Phase 005: Session Management ✅
- Session endpoints with OpenAI SQLiteSession
- POST /projects/{id}/sessions
- POST /sessions/{id}/messages with Socket.io streaming
- DELETE /sessions/{id} for cleanup
- GET /messages/{id}/full for complete OpenAI responses
- Real-time token usage streaming

### Phase 006: Human Review Flow ✅
- Complete diff management endpoints
- GET /projects/{id}/diffs
- GET /sessions/{id}/diffs and /diffs/pending
- POST /diffs/{id}/review for human approval/rejection
- POST /diffs/{id}/commit for git integration
- POST /diffs/{id}/refine-message for message improvement
- Page refresh recovery support

### Phase 007: Deployment 🚧
- Requires external services (Fly.io, GitHub Actions)
- Configuration files can be created but not deployed from this environment

## Test Coverage

- ✅ Integration tests for all phases
- ✅ Real OpenAI API calls in tests
- ✅ Socket.io streaming tests
- ✅ Git operations tests
- ✅ Human review workflow tests
- ✅ Test evidence saved in `validated_test_evidence/`

## Code Quality

- ✅ Type hints throughout
- ✅ Pydantic validation
- ✅ Code formatted with isort and black
- ✅ Flake8 compliance (with minor exceptions)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

## Known Limitations

1. Some tests fail with OpenAI API timeouts (expected with real API)
2. GitService `write_code` method needs implementation
3. Evaluator context clearing not yet implemented
4. Human rejection feedback loop partially implemented

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Fly.io (Phase 007)
2. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD
3. Configure production PostgreSQL
4. Set up monitoring and logging
5. Implement remaining TODO items

## Running the Backend

```bash
# From project root
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./vibegrapher.db
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# From backend directory
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/integration -v -s
```
