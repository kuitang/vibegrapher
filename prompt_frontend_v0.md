# Frontend Agent Instructions for Vibegrapher v0

## Your Mission
Build a React TypeScript interface for vibecoding agents via natural language with human review UI for approving/rejecting code changes. No graph visualization in v0.

**Note: For detailed technical specifications, component interfaces, and architecture details, see `spec_frontend_v0.md`**

## Environment Setup

### Node Environment (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Use Node 18+ and npm
node --version  # Should be 18.x or higher
npm --version   # Should be 9.x or higher

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# .env.local (NEVER commit this file - add to .gitignore) - for LOCAL development
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_WS_URL=http://localhost:8000

# .env.development (for REMOTE development server access)
VITE_API_URL=http://YOUR_DEV_SERVER_IP:8000
VITE_WS_URL=http://YOUR_DEV_SERVER_IP:8000

# .env.production (for production deployment)
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.fly.dev
VITE_WS_URL=https://your-api.fly.dev
```

```

### Testing Strategy (Vitest + Playwright)
- **CRITICAL**: Backend MUST be running or tests fail immediately
- **Integration**: Vitest + React Testing Library (real backend, NO mocking)
- **E2E**: Playwright running HEADLESS (real backend)
- **NO MOCKS**: All tests hit real backend with real OpenAI API
- **Focus**: User flows and component interactions
- **shadcn Testing**: shadcn components are built on Radix UI primitives. Test them by:
  - Using `data-testid` attributes on shadcn component usage
  - Testing by ARIA roles (e.g., `role="dialog"` for Dialog)
  - Using accessible names (e.g., `getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i })`)
  - shadcn doesn't provide test helpers - use standard React Testing Library

### Playwright MCP Manual Testing (BEFORE Writing Scripts)
Before writing Playwright test scripts, use the Playwright MCP server to:
1. **Human-like QA Testing**: Connect to the app and explore like a QA agent
2. **Test Different Workflows**: Click buttons, fill forms, navigate through flows
3. **Monitor Console**: Carefully check error messages and console logs
4. **Take Screenshots**: Capture UI states and analyze them yourself (ensure reasonable size)
5. **Visual Analysis**: Look at the screenshots yourself to spot visual bugs
6. **Test Mobile**: Check at mobile breakpoint (375px width)
7. **Verify Scrolling**: Ensure mobile scrolling behaves correctly
8. **Track Bugs**: Keep a list of discovered issues
9. **Fix Simple Bugs**: Immediately fix and re-test simple issues
10. **Write Scripts for Complex**: Create Playwright scripts for complex bugs
11. **Fresh Project Testing**: Start with a new project, delete when done

### Running Tests
```bash
# PREREQUISITE: Backend must be running!
# Check backend health first:
curl http://localhost:8000/projects || { echo "Backend not running!"; exit 1; }

# IMPORTANT: Always use --watchAll=false for CI/automation
npm test -- --watchAll=false

# Run Vitest tests (headless by default)
npm test -- --run  # Runs once and exits

# Run specific test file
npm test -- --run tests/integration/phase001-layout.test.tsx

# Run E2E tests with Playwright (headless)
# IMPORTANT: Playwright tests MUST use max 30s timeout
# Do NOT set arbitrarily long timeouts
npx playwright test

# Run E2E with UI (for debugging only)
npx playwright test --ui

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```


## shadcn/ui Setup

### Initial Setup (One-time)
```bash
# STAY IN PROJECT ROOT
# Create Vite app from root
npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react-ts

# Install and configure Tailwind + shadcn
cd frontend
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
npx shadcn-ui@latest init

# Add ALL required components upfront
npx shadcn-ui@latest add alert alert-dialog avatar badge button
npx shadcn-ui@latest add card collapsible dialog drawer dropdown-menu
npx shadcn-ui@latest add input popover progress scroll-area separator
npx shadcn-ui@latest add sheet sonner table tabs textarea tooltip
cd ..  # Return to project root
```

## Implementation Phases

**IMPORTANT: Some details in the plan files MAY BE WRONG. They were generated by an LLM. If you find in your own testing they are wrong and that a different approach works better (as long as you meet acceptance criteria), make your UPDATE to the plan file and explain what old information was wrong and what is the replacement.**

See `plans/frontend-phase-*.md` for detailed requirements:

1. **Phase 001**: Core Layout → `plans/frontend-phase-001-layout.md`
2. **Phase 002**: Local Persistence → `plans/frontend-phase-002-local-persistence.md`
3. **Phase 003**: Mobile Responsive → `plans/frontend-phase-003-mobile.md`
4. **Phase 004**: Socket.io Setup → `plans/frontend-phase-004-socketio.md`
5. **Phase 005**: Session Management → `plans/frontend-phase-005-session.md`
6. **Phase 006**: Code Viewer → `plans/frontend-phase-006-code-viewer.md`
7. **Phase 007**: Diff Handling → `plans/frontend-phase-007-diff.md`
8. **Phase 008**: Human Review UI → `plans/frontend-phase-008-human-review.md`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Contains critical E2E test for complete vibecoder workflow
9. **Phase 009**: Production Deployment → `plans/frontend-phase-009-deployment.md`

## Critical Requirements

### Real Backend Integration
- ALL data comes from REAL OpenAI API calls
- NEVER mock token usage or API responses
- Socket.io messages must include trace_id and token usage
- See `spec_frontend_v0.md` for detailed Socket.io integration and state management patterns

### Environment-Aware URLs
```typescript
// CORRECT - Always use environment variables
const API_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || ''

// DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS:
// 1. Local development: VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
// 2. Remote development: VITE_API_URL=http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000
// 3. Production: VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.fly.dev

// WRONG - Hardcoded URLs break in different environments
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000'  // Won't work remotely!
```

## Git Commit Messages
- Keep commits factual and minimal
- Format: "Add/Fix/Update [component]: [what changed]"
- Examples:
  - "Add frontend: vibecode panel component"
  - "Fix websocket: connection error handling"
  - "Update tests: add backend health check"
- No emojis, no business impact statements, no verbose explanations

## Deployment Scenarios

### Local Development (from project root)
- Backend: `uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
- Frontend: `npm --prefix frontend run dev` (runs on :5173)
- Use `frontend/.env.local` with `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`

### Remote Development Access
- Backend: Same as local but accessible via server IP
- Frontend: Use `.env.development` with `VITE_API_URL=http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000`
- Replace `YOUR_SERVER_IP` with actual server IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

### Production (fly.io)
- Backend: Deployed with volumes and PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Use `.env.production` with `VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.fly.dev`
- All connections over HTTPS

## Remember
- Use shadcn/ui components everywhere
- Vitest for integration tests (not Jest)
- Playwright runs HEADLESS
- Log ALL Socket.io messages with trace_id and token usage
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Environment variables for ALL URLs

# Final Instructions - Infinite Loop Workflow
**Work continuously in this loop until you get stuck with errors:**

1. Read the specs files: `spec_datamodel_v0.md` and `spec_frontend_v0.md`
2. Go into the `plans/` directory and find the first frontend document that is not done
3. Check first few lines to see if done - do not read whole file
4. Complete that phase entirely
5. Once done, write a header `# DONE as of commit [commit-hash]`
6. **Re-read specs and this prompt file (to refresh context)**
7. **LOOP BACK TO STEP 2** - find the next incomplete frontend document
8. **Continue this infinite loop until you get stuck with bugs**
9. **ONLY COMMIT WORKING CODE!** - Stop if code doesn't work

## Deployment Notes (Phase 009)
- Deploy to Fly.io EWR region as static site with NGINX
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD (see `plans/frontend-phase-009-deployment.md`)
- Production: never scale to 0, autoscale up to 3
- Preview: scale to 0 for PR deployments
- Multi-stage Docker build for optimization
- Bundle splitting and PWA support
