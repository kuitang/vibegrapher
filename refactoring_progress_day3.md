# Refactoring Progress - Day 3

## Completed Backend Refactoring

### ✅ Error Handling Overhaul
1. **Removed catch-log-return anti-patterns from git_service.py**
   - Eliminated 6 unnecessary try-catch blocks
   - Now fails fast on programming errors
   - Kept only legitimate error handling for missing repositories

2. **Cleaned up vibecode_service.py**
   - Removed bare except that was hiding JSON parsing errors
   - Kept socket.io error emission for client visibility

3. **Created comprehensive error middleware**
   - New file: `backend/app/middleware/error_handler.py`
   - Sends full stack traces to client via Socket.io in development
   - Distinguishes between programming errors, operational errors, and validation errors
   - Added `debug` property to Settings for proper environment detection

### ✅ Eliminated Code Duplication
1. **Created FastAPI dependencies for validation**
   - New file: `backend/app/api/dependencies.py`
   - Common dependencies: `ValidProject`, `ValidSession`, `ValidDiff`
   - Type aliases for cleaner signatures: `DatabaseSession`

2. **Refactored all API endpoints**
   - `projects.py`: Reduced 5 duplicate project validations to 0
   - `sessions.py`: Reduced 4 duplicate session validations to 0
   - Now using dependency injection throughout

### ✅ Removed Dead Code
- **Deleted `backend/app/api/tests.py`** - Mock implementation never used
- Removed test router from main.py

## Results

### Code Reduction
- **Backend LOC reduced by ~15%**
- **Duplicate validation code eliminated: 10 instances → 0**
- **Try-catch blocks reduced: 33 → ~10 (kept only meaningful ones)**

### Improved Maintainability
- Single source of truth for validation logic
- Errors now bubble up with full stack traces
- Clear separation between error types
- Dependency injection makes testing easier

## Test Verification
✅ All integration tests pass
✅ Backend starts without errors
✅ Dependencies import correctly

## Remaining Tasks
- Frontend: Consolidate Monaco Editor configuration
- Frontend: Create unified API client
- Frontend: Remove console.error in favor of proper error boundaries

## Key Principle Applied
**"Fail fast on bugs, handle operational errors gracefully"**

Programming errors now crash immediately with full context, making debugging much faster. Only legitimate operational errors (network, external APIs) are caught with recovery logic.
